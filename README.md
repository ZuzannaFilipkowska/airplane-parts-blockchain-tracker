MDB (Magazyn Danych Blockchain) Project
Welcome to the MDB project repository, a system designed to revolutionize how information about aviation components is stored and managed using blockchain technology.
I developed this project as a crucial component of my engineering thesis, focusing on the topic of "Data Storage of Aircraft Parts Maintenance Using Blockchain Technology."

## Features:
- **Blockchain-Powered Storage:** Securely store and manage aviation component data using the robust blockchain infrastructure.
- **Web Application Interface:** Intuitive web application for seamless interaction with the MDB system.
- **Smart Contracts:** Implementing smart contracts for transparent and secure transactions, ensuring data integrity.
- **User Authentication:** Multi-layered user authentication for controlled access and enhanced security.
- **Hyperledger Fabric Integration:** Leveraging the power of Hyperledger Fabric for a trusted and efficient blockchain network.

## Getting Started:

Setting up the network is described in [run.sh](run.sh).
